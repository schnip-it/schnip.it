  \begin{itemize}[<+>]
    \item We decided to create a Web-based user interface using
      \textbf{HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript} for ease of deployment.

    \item \textbf{jQuery} was used for some special effects.

    % TODO confirm with Jamie
    \item \textbf{Backbone.js} for communicating with the server when
      loading or storing data dynamically.
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Back-End}

  \begin{itemize}[<+>]
    \item \textbf{Python} since it is already familiar to everyone in
      our group and has some good tools for rapid Web development.

    \item \textbf{Django}, a well-respected MVC Web framework,
      provided an assortment of useful development tools.

    \item \textbf{PostgreSQL} is the most standards-compliant Free database we
      found.

    \item But we also used \textbf{SQLite} for distributed development ---
      Django makes the choice of SQL server mostly transparent.
  \end{itemize}
