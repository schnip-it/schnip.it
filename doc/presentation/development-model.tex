  \begin{block}<+>{Scrum}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Divide project up into flexibly-scheduled sprints ---
        suits university schedule (exams \&c.)!
      \item Respond rapidly to changing requirements as we
        discovered them
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}<+>{TDD}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Constantly check our code for errors
      \item Particularly important in Python, as we have no type
        system to guarantee invariants
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
